1. `generate_sankey_chart`: Generate a `sankey` chart, used to display data flow and volume, representing the movement of data between different nodes in a Sankey-style format.
1. `generate_scatter_chart`: Generate a `scatter` plot, used to display the relationship between two variables, showing data points as scattered dots on a coordinate system.
1. `generate_treemap_chart`: Generate a `treemap`, used to display hierarchical data, showing data in rectangular forms where the size of rectangles represents the value of the data.
1. `generate_venn_chart`: Generate a `venn` diagram, used to display relationships between sets, including intersections, unions, and differences.
1. `generate_violin_chart`: Generate a `violin` plot, used to display the distribution of data, combining features of boxplots and density plots to provide a more detailed view of the data distribution.
1. `generate_word_cloud_chart`: Generate a `word-cloud`, used to display the frequency of words in textual data, with font sizes indicating the frequency of each word.
