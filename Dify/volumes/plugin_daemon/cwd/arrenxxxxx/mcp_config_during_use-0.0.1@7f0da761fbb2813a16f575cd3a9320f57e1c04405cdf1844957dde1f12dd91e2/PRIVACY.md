## Data Processing

1. All connection information (URL, headers, etc.) is only used during runtime to establish connections to the configured MCP servers.
2. The plugin does not persistently store any data provided during use.
3. The plugin acts as a pass-through mechanism to discover and call tools on MCP servers.

## Third-Party Services
